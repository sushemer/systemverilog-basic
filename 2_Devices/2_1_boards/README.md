# 2.1 Boards · Base Boards

The `2_1_Boards` folder gathers the specific information of the **FPGA boards** used in this repository.

Its main function is to:

- Document the basic characteristics of each board.
- Explain how to **program** the board and what electrical precautions to take.
- Serve as a reference for Examples, Activities, Labs, and Implementation.

Currently, the repository focuses on the **Tang Nano 9K**, but more boards may be added in the future.
