# 2.2 Sensors · Sensors and inputs

The `2_2_Sensors` folder groups the **input devices** used in the examples, activities, and labs in the repository.

It includes:

- The **HC-SR04** ultrasonic sensor.
- The **rotary encoder** (digital knob).
- **Buttons/switches** (both those on the board and the conceptual ones reused in keys, e.g., TM1638).

The goal is to document, for each sensor:

- What it measures or what function it performs.
- How it is connected to the Tang Nano 9K.
- Which logical signals are involved.
- In which Examples / Activities / Labs it is used.
