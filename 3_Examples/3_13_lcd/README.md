# 3.13 LCD – Basic Static Shapes

This is the **first example** of using the 480×272 LCD screen on the Tang Nano 9K.

The idea is to keep it **as simple as possible**:

- The board wrapper generates the `(x, y)` coordinates of the pixel being drawn.
- Our `hackathon_top` module decides the **color** of that pixel:
  - Black background.
  - A red vertical bar.
  - A green horizontal bar.
  - A yellow rectangle in the center of the screen.
- No movement, no counters, no use of keys.

It is simply: **“if the pixel falls within a specific region, paint it a certain color.”**

## Objective

At the end of this example, the user will be able to:

- Understand the basic idea of the LCD interface:
  - The system provides `(x, y)` for each pixel.
  - The design outputs a color (`red`, `green`, `blue`).
- Draw **rectangular regions** and bars on the screen using comparisons on `x` and `y`.
- See how combinational logic translates into visible graphics on the LCD.

## Relevant Signals

### Inputs

- `x[8:0]`, `y[8:0]`  
  Coordinates of the current pixel:

  - `x`: 0 … 479  
  - `y`: 0 … 271  

  These coordinates are automatically generated by the board's video logic (Tang Nano 9K LCD wrapper).

### Outputs

- `red[4:0]`, `green[5:0]`, `blue[4:0]`  
  Color of the current pixel. Typical 16-bit RGB 5-6-5 format:

  - `red = 0` → no red, `red = 31` → full red  
  - `green = 0` → no green, `green = 63` → full green  
  - `blue = 0` → no blue, `blue = 31` → full blue  

This example uses:

- Background: `(0, 0, 0)` → black  
- Vertical bar: `(31, 0, 0)` → bright red  
- Horizontal bar: `(0, 50, 0)` → medium green  
- Central rectangle: `(31, 63, 0)` → yellow (red + green)

## Internal Structure of the Design

In this example, the graphics do not depend on the clock or reset to decide the color;  
the logic is purely combinational based on `(x, y)`.

The typical structure of `hackathon_top` is:

1. **Screen parameters**

   Define constants to make the code readable:

   - `SCREEN_WIDTH  = 480`
   - `SCREEN_HEIGHT = 272`

   Optionally define the positions of the shapes:

   - `BAR_V_X = 100` with a certain width  
   - `BAR_H_Y = 50` with a certain height  
   - Coordinates for the central rectangle  

2. **Non-graphical outputs**

   Since this example does not use LEDs, 7-segment display or GPIO:

   - `led        = 8'b0000_0000`
   - `abcdefgh  = 8'b0000_0000`
   - `digit     = 8'b0000_0000`
   - `gpio      = 'z`

3. **Color logic (combinational)**

   Implemented in an `always_comb` following this structure:

   - Step 1: **default background** (black)
   - Step 2: If pixel is in the **red vertical bar**, overwrite color
   - Step 3: If in **green horizontal bar**, overwrite color
   - Step 4: If in **yellow central rectangle**, overwrite color

   **Drawing priority** is defined by the order of conditions.

## Relation to Other Examples

- This example relies on the video wrapper also used in later labs.
- Serves as a foundation before:
  - Animations
  - Moving shapes
  - Text, sprites, and more complex graphics
  - Combining keyboard/sensor input with LCD drawing

---

## Possible Extensions

- Change bar colors using keys (`key[7:0]`).
- Move shapes based on counters or sensors.
- Divide the screen into color quadrants as a practice.
- Add borders to the central rectangle.

This example shows how simple combinational logic based on pixel coordinates can draw graphics on the Tang Nano 9K LCD.
