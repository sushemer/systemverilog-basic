# 4_9_7 – LCD “HELLO” + Basic Graphics

This activity is based on `4_7_lcd_hello_and_basic_graphics` and is included in the `4_9_solutions` folder.

## Objective

Practice basic LCD graphics (480×272) using only:

- Pixel coordinates (`x`, `y`)
- Range comparisons
- Assignments to RGB outputs

The module:

- Draws a **white frame** around the screen.
- Fills the interior with a **soft blue/gray background**.
- Reserves a central band for the text **“HELLO”**, built using rectangular strokes.
- Adds a **bottom status bar** whose color depends on `key[0]`.
- Mirrors the `key` vector directly to the LEDs.

## Signal Mapping

### Inputs

- `clock`: main FPGA clock  
- `reset`: global reset  
- `key[7:0]`: keyboard input  
  - `key[0]` controls the color of the bottom bar  
  - All bits are copied to `led[7:0]`

- `x`, `y`: pixel coordinates generated by the LCD driver  
  - `x` in `0..479`  
  - `y` in `0..271`

### Outputs

- `red[4:0]`, `green[5:0]`, `blue[4:0]`: RGB 5-6-5 pixel color  
- `led[7:0]`: mirrors the key input  
- Seven-segment display outputs are unused (set to zero)

## Drawing Structure

The drawing logic follows this order:

1. Initialize background to black.
2. Draw the **outer white frame**.
3. Fill the interior with a **blue/gray background**.
4. Create a **text band** in the center.
5. Draw “HELLO” using simple rectangular strokes:
   - H = 2 vertical bars + mid horizontal bar  
   - E = 1 vertical bar + 3 horizontal bars  
   - L = 1 vertical bar + 1 bottom bar  
   - O = rectangle border  
6. Draw a **bottom status bar**:
   - Green if `key[0] = 1`
   - Blue if `key[0] = 0`

Each condition overwrites the previous color, creating layered graphics.

## HELLO Band

The HELLO area is defined by:

- Vertical range:  
  `HELLO_TOP = 80`  
  `HELLO_BOTTOM = 200`

- Horizontal range:  
  Starting at `HELLO_X0 = 60`  
  Width per letter: `LETTER_W = 60`  

Each letter is mapped to:

- H: X = 60–119  
- E: X = 120–179  
- L: X = 180–239  
- L: X = 240–299  
- O: X = 300–359

## Bottom Status Bar

Located at:

y >= SCREEN_H - 30


Color logic:

- `key[0] = 1` → **Green**
- `key[0] = 0` → **Blue**

---

## Suggested Tests

1. **Check the frame**  
   Screen should show a perfect white border.

2. **Check HELLO rendering**  
   Letters must appear clean, centered, and aligned.

3. **Check color switching**  
   Toggle `key[0]` and observe the bottom bar switching between blue/green.

4. **Check LEDs**  
   Press keys and verify LED mirroring.

## Optional Extensions

- Replace “HELLO” with another word (“FPGA”, “HACK”, etc.)
- Add animations (scrolling letters, fade bar, blinking text)
- Add a top bar or side panel with additional info
- Add simple icons or shapes built from rectangles

This solution demonstrates the fundamentals of drawing static graphics using rectangular regions and conditional color overrides on a 480×272 RGB LCD.
