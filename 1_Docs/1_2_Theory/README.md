# 1.2 Theory · Short and applied theory

The `1_2_Theory` folder contains **short, focused theory files**.  
Their purpose is to provide only the essential concepts needed to:

- Understand what each example, activity, and lab is doing  
- Make basic design decisions when working with the Tang Nano 9K  
- Connect the language (Verilog/SystemVerilog) with real hardware (FPGA + peripherals)  

Each file focuses on a specific topic and is not meant to be complete or formal theory.  
Instead, it is a direct complement to hands-on work.

## How to use this folder

- **Before starting a new topic**  
  Read the corresponding theory file (e.g., PWM before LED dimmer, ADC before potentiometer use)

- **During a lab**  
  Use theory as a quick reference for syntax or concepts  

The theory is intended to be used **on demand**, not as mandatory linear reading.
