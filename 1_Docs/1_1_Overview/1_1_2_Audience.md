# 1.1.2 Audience – Who is this repository for?

This material is mainly intended for:

- Engineering students (or related fields) taking courses in **Digital Electronics, Microcontrollers, Digital Systems, or Programmable Logic**, who want to practice using a real FPGA.
- People with basic programming experience (C, Python, etc.) who want to transition into **digital design with HDL (SystemVerilog)**.
- Instructors who need a set of **reusable examples and practices** for short courses, workshops, or digital design clubs.

It is assumed that the user:

- Has basic knowledge of digital logic (AND, OR, NOT, flip-flops, counters).
- Can install software on Windows or Linux (VS Code, Git, Gowin IDE, etc.).
- Is willing to read and modify code, run scripts, and check synthesis error messages.

This repository is **not** intended as a pure theory book, but rather as a practical complement:

- It does not replace a complete Digital Electronics course, but helps connect theory with practice.
- It does not aim to cover all of SystemVerilog, only a useful subset for designing and debugging small-to-medium modules: counters, FSMs, decoders, sensor interfaces, display drivers, etc.

In summary, it is intended for anyone who wants to **learn by doing**, using a concrete platform (Tang Nano 9K + peripherals) and a workflow (VS Code + Git + scripts + Gowin).
