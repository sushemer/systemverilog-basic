# 1.1.3 Results – What will you be able to do once you finish?

By working through this repository, you should be able to:

- Write and understand SystemVerilog modules with clearly defined inputs and outputs.
- Implement and debug combinational logic (gates, mux/decoder, simple comparators).
- Design simple state machines (traffic lights, sequences, locks, basic menus).
- Implement counters, frequency dividers, and basic PWM to control LEDs, servos, or other actuators.
- Integrate external peripherals such as:
  - **TM1638** module (7-segments + LEDs + keys).
  - **HC-SR04** ultrasonic sensor.
  - Rotary encoders and potentiometers (via external ADC).
  - **480×272 LCD** display (driven from the board’s top module).

Additionally, you will:

- Become familiar with a typical workflow:
  - Editor (VS Code).
  - Version control (Git).
  - Synthesis and programming scripts for Gowin.
- Read, understand, and modify existing examples instead of always starting from scratch.
- Better understand what the synthesis tool does and how to interpret common errors and warnings.
