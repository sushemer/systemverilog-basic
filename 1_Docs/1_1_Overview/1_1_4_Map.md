# 1.1.4 Map – How does this documentation connect with the rest of the repository?

The `1_docs` folder is not isolated: it accompanies the code found in:

- `2_devices/`
- `3_examples/`
- `4_activities/`
- `5_laboratorie/`
- `6_implementation/`

This document explains, at a high level, how these parts relate to one another.

## 1. Main layers of the repository

### 1.1 Documentation (`1_docs/`)

`1_docs/` gathers all written support material:

- **`1_1_overview/`**  
  Presents the project purpose, audience, expected results, and this general map.

- **`1_2_theory/`**  
  Summaries of digital logic and SystemVerilog concepts used frequently across activities and labs.

- **`1_3_install/`** (installation guides)  
  Instructions to set up the environment on Windows and Linux: Visual Studio Code, Git, cloning the repository, and Gowin IDE.

- **`1_4_glossary/`**  
  Contains short definitions, naming conventions, and quick reminders.

- **`1_5_howto/`**  
  Practical guides on:
  - Hardware connections.
  - Code flow (`board_specific_top` → `hackathon_top` → peripherals).
  - How to run scripts for simulation, synthesis, and programming.
  - Common errors, warnings, precautions, and troubleshooting.

Together, `1_docs` acts as the companion manual for the rest of the repository.

### 1.2 Devices (`2_devices/`)

`2_devices/` describes the hardware used in the exercises:

- **Tang Nano 9K** board.
- **TM1638** module.
- Sensors (e.g., HC-SR04, potentiometer/ADC, rotary encoder KY-040).
- **480×272 LCD** screen.

This folder documents:

- Pinouts and relevant signals.
- Notes on power supply, logic levels, and safety.
- References and links to datasheets.

---

### 1.3 Examples (`3_examples/`)

`3_examples/` contains reference examples—often adapted from other educational repositories—that demonstrate:

- Basic graphics on the LCD.
- Audio usage (when applicable).
- Integration of LCD, TM1638, and other peripherals.

Their main purpose is to serve as **fully working demonstrations** to study and, if necessary, adapt to activities, labs, or implementations.  
They are not designed as step-by-step exercises.

---

### 1.4 Activities (`4_activities/`)

Activities are short exercises focused on a specific concept, such as:

- Logic gates and De Morgan’s laws.
- Multiplexers and decoders.
- Priority encoder with `valid` flag.
- 4-bit mini-ALU.
- Counters and LED patterns.
- Experiments with 7-segment displays.
- First contact with LCD and sensors.

Typical components of each activity:

- A `hackathon_top.sv` file with commented `TODO` sections.
- Hints indicating the missing logic to implement.
- Limited use of external modules—only the essentials.

---

### 1.5 laboratorie (`5_laboratories/`)

Labs are more integrated practices. They combine several concepts previously worked on in activities, such as:

- A “hello world” counter with a frequency divider.
- Buttons with integrated debounce on an FSM.
- Patterns using shift registers.
- FSM traffic light combined with a “sequence lock”.
- TM1638 integration (7 segments + LEDs).
- Sensor and LCD integration.

Characteristics of labs:

- A more extensive `hackathon_top.sv`.
- Reuse of common modules in `labs/common/` and `peripherals/`.
- Greater emphasis on testing, verification checklists, and visible results on the board.

---

### 1.6 Implementations (`6_implementation/`)

Implementations are mini-projects that can serve as final deliverables or end-of-course assignments, such as:

- A digital clock using 7-segments or TM1638.
- A “radar-style” system with ultrasonic sensor and LCD visualization.

In this section, the user is expected to:

- Combine blocks used in activities and labs.
- Make architectural decisions (FSM structure, interfaces, menus, state handling).
- Document their solution and justify design choices.

## 2. How to use this map in practice

When unsure of the next step, follow this route:

1. Read `1_1_1_Purpose` and `1_1_2_Audience` to recall the general goal and target user.
2. Check `1_1_3_Results` to identify the skills and outcomes expected.
3. Return to this `1_1_4_Map` to find where to navigate:
   - Theory and support guides → `1_docs/`.
   - Hardware descriptions and pinouts → `2_devices/`.
   - Complete reference examples → `3_examples/`.
   - Short conceptual exercises → `4_activities/`.
   - More comprehensive, integrated practices → `5_labs/`.
   - Mini-projects closer to real applications → `6_implementation/`.

For operational topics (connections, module flow, scripts), refer to the guides in `1_5_howto`.
