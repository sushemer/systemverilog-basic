# 1.1.1 Purpose – What is the purpose of this repository?

This repository gathers examples, activities, and guided practices to learn **SystemVerilog** using the **Tang Nano 9K** board and a set of specific peripherals:

- **TM1638** module (7-segment display + LEDs + keys).
- **HC-SR04** ultrasonic sensor.
- Rotary encoders (KY-040).
- Potentiometers (via external ADC).
- **480×272 LCD** display.

Its main purpose is to offer a structured learning path that goes from:

- Logic gates and simple combinational modules.
- Counters, finite state machines (FSM), and basic PWM.
- Integration with real peripherals (sensors, displays, external modules).
- Final mini-projects that combine all of the above.

This repository is organized so you can:

- Reinforce theory with small, progressive exercises.
- Connect SystemVerilog code with real hardware from the beginning.
- Reuse blocks (drivers, counters, filters, FSMs, etc.) across different **activities**, **labs**, and **implementations**.
- Move from “trying isolated things” to building complete solutions on a single platform (Tang Nano 9K + peripherals).
